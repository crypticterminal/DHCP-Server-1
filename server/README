give permissions before execution
=>chmod 777 server

run as follows:
=>./server

=>server always takes in the subsconf file and it will be preprocess all the labs and does subnetting in labs.
=>If subnetting is not possible within labs it will be output the error msg without even an client request.
=>if more clients it sends msg to client appropriately.
=>now we will be seeing the IP addr of server in any lab.
=>For the remaining range we will be leaving off one address.
